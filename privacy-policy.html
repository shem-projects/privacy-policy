    <h1>Privacy Policy for SnapSense</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: March 12, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to SnapSense! We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we keep it safe. By using SnapSense, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following information when you use SnapSense:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Address</strong>: We collect your email address when you provide it to us (e.g., during account setup or app usage). This helps us manage your account and communicate with you about the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong>: When you upload a photo from your device or take a photo using the app, we process it to provide you with DSLR camera setting recommendations. We do not store your photos at any point.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We may collect non-identifying information about how you use the app, such as app interactions and device type, to improve our services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect your name or other identifying details beyond your email address.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Address</strong>: To manage your account, send you app-related updates, or respond to your inquiries.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong>: To analyze your images and generate DSLR camera setting advice. Photos are temporarily processed and submitted to an external large language model (LLM) for analysis, but they are not stored by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: To enhance app performance and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your email address with third parties, except as required by law. However:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>External LLM</strong>: We submit your uploaded photos to an external large language model (LLM) to generate camera setting recommendations. We do not store your photos; they are only temporarily processed and transmitted to the LLM without your email address or any other identifying information. The LLM’s use of the photos is governed by its own privacy policy, which you can request further details about by contacting us.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Your email address and usage data are stored securely in AWS Firestore, a cloud database provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). We do not store your photos at any point—photos are only temporarily processed during analysis and then discarded.</li>
        <li><strong>Security</strong>: We use industry-standard measures, such as encryption and access controls, to protect your data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion</strong>:You may delete all your user data via the application user profile page with the "Delete My Account" function, or by contacting us at snapsenseapp@gmail.com</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AWS Firestore</strong>: We use AWS Firestore to store your email address and app data. AWS’s privacy practices are detailed at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>External LLM</strong>: Photos are temporarily processed by an external LLM for analysis and are not stored by us. We ensure no identifying information is included with the photos. For more information about the LLM’s privacy practices, please contact us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Deletion</strong>: You may request access to or deletion of your email address by contacting us at [insert contact email]. We’ll respond within a reasonable timeframe. Since we do not store your photos, no photo deletion is necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: You can stop using the app at any time to cease data collection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>SnapSense is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with an updated “Last Updated” date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
